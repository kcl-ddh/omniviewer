jQuery OmniViewer is a port of the SourceForge.net IIPImage project (IIPMooViewer Ajax Javascript Client v1.1) for the jQuery framework.

The Zoomify support is somehow based on OpenLayers code.

The Djatoka support is a jQuery port of the Djatoka viewer's code (which in turn is based on the IIPMooViewer).
