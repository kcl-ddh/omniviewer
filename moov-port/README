IIPMooViewer - Ajax Viewer for IIPImage - Version 1.1

You first must have a working version of the IIPImage server running. 
See http://iipimage.sourceforge.net for details.

Create a pyramidal tiled TIFF image using VIPS (http://vips.sf.net) or 
imagemagick.

Then use and modify the path and image names in the example HTML page 
provided - iiipmooviewer.html to create a working client :-)

You must include the mootools and iipmooviewer header files, as well as 
the iip.css stylesheet. For further details see the HTML file included. 
You will find included both uncompressed and compressed versions of the
javascript and css files made using YUIcompressor.

        or false [default : true]
