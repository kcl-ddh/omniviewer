	  false :)

19/07/2008:

	  instead of creating separate FX instances.

21/01/2008:
	- Updated mootools to version 1.2b2!

22/01/2008
	- Fixed tile offset caused by rounding error. The image sizes are now 
          calculated by counting down from the max resolution rather than by simply 
          multiplying up and down.

10/08/2007:
	- Fixed problem with IE when the view is changed midway during tile download. 
          The list of tiles is
	  not deleted by IE even though the image elements have been destroyed.  
          Solved by setting the tiles
	  to an already downloaded image before destroying.
	- Window can now be embedded into any size div anywhere on the page. However, 
          it's positioning must
	  be absolute.
